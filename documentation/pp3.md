### Introduction
This project seeks to implement a playable version of the board game Monopoly.

&nbsp;
### Data structures

A game of Monopoly can be decomposed into a single, large data structure, and this comprises the core of this project.

The primary data element is the board, containing information about all players, spaces, and game events. However, this largely acts as a container for the state of the game, with some inputs and outputs that are validated and manipulated slightly. The manipulation of this data is delegated to the Controller class group.
